        <h2>Community Yoga Retreat</h2>
        <p>Take a break from the noise and reconnect with your inner calm at our weekend Community Yoga Retreat. We believe in yoga as a lifelong practice—not a performance.</p>
        <p>Our studio is a place to reset, recharge, and return to yourself without judgment or pressure. Located just outside the city, this peaceful gathering includes guided yoga, meditation, nourishing meals, and time in nature.</p>
        <p>Your practice starts exactly where you are—and so do we. Open to all levels, the retreat is a chance to unwind, reflect, and build deeper community through shared practice. </p>
